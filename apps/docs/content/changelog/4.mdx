We've added bulk actions for cards, auto‑save and context‑menu saving, a subscription page, and an upgrade prompt. Loading is smoother with Suspense and an error boundary, plus new thumbnails and visual tweaks make Teak feel faster and clearer.

### Highlights

- ✨ **New Feature**: Bulk action bar for selecting and deleting multiple cards
- ✨ **New Feature**: Auto‑save and context‑menu options to store pages, text, and images
- ✨ **New Feature**: Subscription page with billing management and upgrade prompt for card limits
