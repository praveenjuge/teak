Teak helps designers save inspiration in 1 click and find it in 2 seconds—no more lost bookmarks or messy folders.

## Why Teak?

Every designer has the same problem: you find the perfect button, gradient, or layout—then lose it forever in a sea of bookmarks, screenshots, and "inspiration" folders.

Teak fixes this by:

- **Instant saving** — One click from any browser, phone, or app
- **Smart organization** — AI auto-tags and categorizes everything
- **Lightning search** — Type "blue button" and find it in 2 seconds
- **Cross-platform sync** — Save on mobile, find on desktop

## Common Use Cases

### Building a Design System
Save UI patterns, component examples, and interaction references. Search by component type to find exactly what you need when building new features.

### Client Mood Boards
Collect visual references for client projects. Share curated collections or export for presentations.

### Learning & Reference
Save tutorials, code snippets, and documentation. Voice notes let you capture quick ideas on the go.

### Color & Typography Research
Extract color palettes from any image. Save font pairings and typography examples with full context.
