## Search & Organization

### Visual Search
Search across all your cards using natural language. Teak searches titles, descriptions, tags, transcriptions, and extracted text.

```
Examples:
- "blue button hover state"
- "onboarding flow mobile"

```

### Smart Tagging
AI automatically analyzes your content and applies relevant tags. You can also add custom tags manually.

### Filtering
Filter by card type, favorites, tags, or date. Combine filters to narrow down large collections quickly.

### Masonry Grid
Browse your inspiration in a Pinterest-style grid that adapts to different content sizes and aspect ratios.
