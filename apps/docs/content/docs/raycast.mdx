Use Teak in Raycast to quickly save text or links, search all cards, and jump to favorites without leaving your keyboard flow.

## Requirements

- Raycast installed on macOS
- Teak account
- One active Teak API key

## 1) Generate an API key in Teak

1. Open Teak Settings: `/settings`
2. Go to **API Keys**
3. Click **Generate API Key**
4. Copy the key immediately (it is shown once)

## 2) Install the extension in Raycast

1. Open Raycast
2. Open the Store listing: [Raycast Store search](https://www.raycast.com/store?query=teak)
3. Search for **Teak**
4. Install the extension

## 3) Configure extension preferences

Set the following in Raycast extension settings:

- `API Key`: key generated in Teak settings

## Publishing status

- The extension is prepared for Raycast Store review.
- Once approved, this page will be updated with the final direct Store URL.

## Commands

### Quick Save

- Paste or type content in a large text area before saving
- If content is an HTTP(S) URL:
  - Teak checks for duplicates
  - Existing card is reused when found
- Otherwise Teak creates a text card

### Search Cards

- Searches across all card types
- Returns up to 50 results
- Excludes deleted cards
- Actions: open source URL, copy content/URL, view metadata

### Favorites

- Dedicated command for favorited cards
- Read-only list behavior in v1
- Same open/copy/detail actions as search

## Security model

- API keys are hashed server-side
- Only one active key is allowed per account
- Regenerating a key revokes the previous key immediately
- You can revoke keys at any time from Teak settings
