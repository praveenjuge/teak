## Overview

Teak protects your privacy across the web app, mobile app, and browser extension. We store and process your personal design inspiration securely.

## Data We Collect

- **Account data:** Better Auth authentication, profile info (name, email, optional photo), account preferences.
- **Your content:** Cards (notes, links, images, videos, audio, documents), metadata (timestamps, tags, favorites), and securely stored file uploads.
- **Usage data:** How you interact with our services, device/browser info for compatibility, and error logs for service improvement.
- **Extension data:** Current page URL when you save content, text you explicitly select to save, and context menu interactions.

## How We Use Your Data

- **Primary uses:** Store, organize, and sync your content; enable cross-platform access; process metadata and thumbnails; power search functionality.
- **Secondary uses:** Improve service quality, provide technical support, maintain security, and meet legal requirements.

## Data Security

- Storage on secure Convex servers (US-based)
- Industry-standard encryption in transit and at rest
- Better Auth-managed secure login
- Isolation so your data stays private from other users
- Automated backups for data durability

## Sharing & Disclosure

- We **never** share your personal content for advertising or third-party analytics; your cards and files remain private.
- Limited disclosure only for legal requirements (court orders), safety concerns, essential service providers, or business transfers (mergers/acquisitions).

## Your Rights & Controls

- Access: view all your content through our apps.
- Export: download your data in standard formats.
- Delete: remove individual cards or your entire account.
- Control: manage privacy preferences.

**Deletion timeline:** soft delete provides a 30-day recovery period; permanent deletion happens after 30 days; full account deletion completes within 30 days of request.

## Platform Practices

- **Web app:** essential cookies for authentication, local storage for performance, secure session management.
- **Mobile app:** device permissions only when used (camera, mic, photos), local caching for offline access, optional push notifications.
- **Browser extension:** active tab access only when saving content, no background monitoring, activates only on user interaction.

## International Data

Data may be processed outside your country, but primary storage remains in the US with strong privacy protections.
