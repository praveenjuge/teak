## Support & FAQ Content

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What permissions does Teak need and why?**
A: Teak only requests minimal permissions needed for core functionality: storage (for your content), activeTab (to save current page), contextMenus (right-click options), and scripting (to extract selected text). We never access your full browsing history.

**Q: Is my data secure?**  
A: Yes. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We use industry-standard security practices and only store content you explicitly choose to save.

**Q: Can I export my data?**
A: Absolutely. You can export all your content in standard formats and delete your account at any time.

**Q: Does it work on all websites?**
A: Teak works on virtually all websites. The only exceptions are browser internal pages (like chrome://settings) where extensions cannot run for security reasons.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Teak is free to use with generous limits. Premium plans offer additional storage and advanced features for power users.
