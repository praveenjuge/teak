## Problem/Solution Tweets

1. Your bookmarks are where links go to die. Teak is where they come back to life.

2. I've saved 1,000+ bookmarks and never looked at them again. So I built something different.

3. The problem with bookmarking tools: they're great at capturing, terrible at rediscovery.

4. You know you saved something perfect for your current project. You just can't find it. That's the problem I'm solving.

5. Capture should be frictionless. Rediscovery should be intelligent. Most tools only get the first part right.

6. I keep finding amazing content but can never find it when I need it. So I built Teak.

7. Browser bookmarks are a graveyard. I built something that makes them useful again.

8. The value of saved inspiration isn't in having it—it's in finding it when you need it.

9. Stop hoarding bookmarks. Start building a visual knowledge base that actually works.

10. You don't need another bookmarking tool. You need a rediscovery engine.

## Feature Tweets

### Capture

11. Save from anywhere. Web, mobile, browser extension. Everything syncs in real-time.

12. Just shipped: Voice notes with AI transcription. Because sometimes you need to capture ideas out loud.

13. Teak now captures 8 types of content: text, links, images, videos, audio, documents, color palettes, and quotes.

14. One-click save from any page. The Teak browser extension is live.

15. Just pasted a link into Teak and it automatically:
- Fetched the metadata
- Generated tags
- Created a summary
- Extracted images
- Detected the category

This is what bookmarking should feel like.

### AI Features

16. What if your bookmarking tool actually read everything you saved?

Teak uses AI to:
- Auto-tag your saves
- Generate summaries
- Categorize content
- Transcribe audio
- Extract colors from images

17. I don't organize my bookmarks. AI does it for me.

18. Just saved a design and Teak automatically extracted the color palette. This is why I built it.

19. Teak's AI just categorized my last 50 saves and I didn't lift a finger.

20. Auto-tagging, auto-summarization, auto-categorization. The future of bookmarking is zero-organization.

### Rediscovery

21. Search across your content, notes, tags, summaries, and metadata—all at once.

22. Found something I saved 6 months ago by searching for a feeling. That's the power of AI.

23. The best search is the one where you actually find what you're looking for.

### Visual

24. Why do bookmarking tools look like spreadsheets from 1999?

Your inspiration deserves better. Teak is visual-first.

25. Masonry grid. Rich previews. Visual browsing. Bookmarking for people who care about design.

---

## Behind the Scenes Tweets

26. Building in public: I'm working on a bookmarking tool that actually helps you find what you've saved.

27. Why I built Teak: I was tired of saving things and never finding them again.

28. The stack behind Teak:
- Frontend: Next.js 16 + React 19
- Backend: Convex
- Mobile: React Native + Expo
- Extension: Wxt (Chrome)

29. Just shipped [feature]. Here's what went wrong:

30. Today I learned: Convex's real-time sync makes multi-platform bookmarking actually enjoyable.

31. I chose Convex for Teak's backend because:
- Real-time sync is built-in
- Search is powerful
- Serverless functions are fast
- Workflow orchestration handles AI processing

32. Spent the weekend debugging why screenshots weren't generating. Turned out I was rate-limiting myself. Classic.

33. Working on open source feels different. Every contribution, every bug report—it all means more.

34. The hardest part of building Teak wasn't the AI. It was making the masonry grid feel smooth on mobile.

35. Just merged a PR that adds [feature]. Thanks to [contributor] for the help!

---

## Philosophy Tweets

36. The best note-taking system is the one you actually use. Same goes for bookmarking.

37. Your second brain shouldn't require a PhD to set up.

38. Organize later. Capture now.

39. The value of a personal knowledge hub isn't storage—it's serendipitous rediscovery.

40. Most productivity tools ask you to do more work. Teak does the work for you.

41. I don't want a better bookmarking tool. I want to actually find what I've saved.

42. You shouldn't have to be organized to be inspired.

43. The problem with "read later" apps: they're great at reading, terrible at finding later.

44. Bookmarking is broken. Not because we can't save things—but because we can't find what we saved.

45. Capture everything. Let AI sort it out. Find what matters.

---

## Question Tweets (Engagement)

46. What's your system for saving links? I've tried everything and nothing sticks.

47. How do you organize your bookmarks? Or do you just... never look at them?

48. What's the one feature you wish every bookmarking tool had?

49. Quick poll: How many bookmarks do you have?
- 0-100
- 100-1,000
- 1,000-10,000
- I've lost count

50. Be honest: How often do you go back to things you've bookmarked?

51. What's your "read later" app of choice? (And do you actually read them later?)

52. Designers: Where do you save inspiration when you find it?

53. What's the oldest bookmark in your browser that you've never used?

54. Would you pay for a bookmarking tool that actually helps you find what you've saved?

55. Tags or folders? What actually works for organizing bookmarks?

## Thread Ideas

### Thread 1: Why I Built Teak

1/8
I've saved thousands of bookmarks over the years. Articles, designs, videos, things I wanted to reference later.

I never look at them.

2/8
Browser bookmarks are a graveyard. You save things with good intentions, but then:
- No visual previews
- No search to speak of
- No organization beyond folders
- Out of sight, out of mind

3/8
I tried everything. Notion (too slow), Pocket (read later, not find later), Pinterest (social, not private), Raindrop (better, but still manual).

None of them solved the real problem: rediscovery.

4/8
The problem isn't capturing—we're all great at saving things.

The problem is finding what you saved when you actually need it. Weeks, months later. When you're working on a project and know you saw something perfect...

5/8
So I built Teak.

- Save from anywhere (web, mobile, browser extension)
- AI automatically tags, categorizes, and summarizes
- Visual grid layout, not lists
- Powerful search across everything

6/8
The key insight: capture should be effortless, but rediscovery should be intelligent.

AI does the heavy lifting so you don't have to organize anything manually.

7/8
It's open source, privacy-first, and works across all your devices in real-time.

8/8
Your bookmarks shouldn't be where links go to die.

### Thread 2: The Evolution of Personal Knowledge Management

1/6
A thread on how personal knowledge management evolved from browser bookmarks to AI-powered rediscovery.

2/6
**Era 1: Browser Bookmarks**
- folders within folders
- no metadata
- "I know I saved it somewhere"
- the digital equivalent of a shoebox

3/6
**Era 2: Read-Later Apps**
- Pocket, Instapaper
- great for articles
- still just a list
- finding things later is pain

4/6
**Era 3: Knowledge Bases**
- Notion, Obsidian, Roam
- powerful but complex
- require manual organization
- maintenance becomes a job

5/6
**Era 4: AI-Powered Rediscovery**
- automatic organization
- semantic search
- visual-first
- zero maintenance

6/6
The future isn't better ways to organize. It's not having to organize at all.

---

### Thread 3: How We Built Teak's AI Pipeline

1/7
Technical thread: How Teak processes content with AI in real-time.

2/7
When you save a link to Teak, a lot happens behind the scenes:

1. Fetch the page
2. Extract metadata (title, description, images)
3. Detect content type
4. Run AI classification
5. Generate tags and summary
6. Create visual thumbnail

3/7
We use Convex workflows to orchestrate this pipeline. Each step runs independently, in parallel where possible.

4/7
For AI, we use Groq with multiple models:
- Fast models for classification
- Smart models for summarization
- Vision models for images
- Audio models for transcription

5/7
The trick: prompt caching. We cache shared prompts and see ~50% cost savings on token usage.

6/7
We also show optimistic UI updates. The card appears instantly while AI processes in the background.

7/7
Result: You save something, and it's fully processed with tags, summary, and metadata in seconds.

### Thread 4: Teak vs. The Competition

1/6
How Teak compares to other bookmarking tools—and why I built something new.

2/6
**vs. Pocket**
Pocket is great for "read later." But what about "find months later?"

Teak has rich search across all your content, not just a reading queue.

3/6
**vs. Notion**
Notion is powerful, but saving anything requires context-switching.

Teak is one-click from any page. Plus AI auto-organization.

4/6
**vs. Pinterest**
Pinterest is beautiful but social. Your boards are public by default.

Teak is private by design. Your inspiration is yours.

5/6
**vs. Raindrop**
Raindrop is solid bookmark management. But you still manually organize.

Teak's AI does the organizing for you.

6/6
The difference: Teak is built for rediscovery, not just capture.

### Thread 5: 8 Types of Content Teak Handles

1/9
Teak isn't just for links. Here are the 8 types of content you can save:

2/9
1. **Text Cards** — Quick notes, ideas, thoughts. For when you need to jot something down.

3/9
2. **Link Cards** — Web pages with auto-metadata. Title, description, images, all fetched automatically.

4/9
3. **Image Cards** — Screenshots, mockups, mood boards. Visual inspiration at a glance.

5/9
4. **Video Cards** — Animation references, tutorials, talks. Watch without leaving.

6/9
5. **Audio Cards** — Voice notes with AI transcription. Speak your ideas, get text back.

7/9
6. **Document Cards** — PDFs, guidelines, design systems. Reference material at your fingertips.

8/9
7. **Palette Cards** — Color extraction from images. Save a design, get the palette automatically.

9/9
8. **Quote Cards** — Highlights with context. Save the words that move you.

Your creative life is multimodal. Your bookmarking tool should be too.

1. You're afraid to look at your bookmark count
2. You Google things you know you've saved
3. Your "to read" folder is overflowing
4. You've tried 3+ different tools
5. You still can't find anything

62. 3 things Teak does that Pocket doesn't:
1. Visual grid browsing (not a list)

## Behind the Scenes: Technical Deep Dives

146. Why I chose Convex over Firebase for Teak:
- Built-in workflows for AI pipelines
- Real-time subscriptions are first-class
- No "frontend/backend" separation in code
- Vector search coming soon

147. The tech stack behind Teak:
- Frontend: Next.js 16 + React 19
- Backend: Convex (real-time, full-text search)
- Mobile: React Native + Expo
- Extension: Wxt (Chrome)
- AI: Groq (fast inference)

148. Convex workflows are incredible for orchestrating AI pipelines. Each step runs independently, retries on failure, and emits progress. Makes async processing feel simple.

149. Next.js 16 + React 19 + React Compiler = smooth UI even with real-time updates. The masonry grid stays at 60fps even with 1,000+ cards.

150. Using Wxt for the Chrome extension has been a breeze. Same stack as the web app, less context-switching, TypeScript everywhere.

151. Groq's speed makes AI feel instant. No waiting 10 seconds for a summary. You save something, and it's processed before you can refresh.

152. The masonry grid uses virtualization for performance. Even with 1,000+ cards, scrolling stays smooth. Only visible items render.

153. Just shipped: Teak now generates SVG thumbnails for image cards. No more blurry previews, no more waiting for screenshots to load.

154. Open source because your inspiration shouldn't be locked in a walled garden. Self-hostable. API-first. Your data, your infrastructure.

155. How Teak processes content with AI in real-time:
1. Fetch the page
2. Extract metadata (title, description, images)
3. Detect content type
4. Run AI classification
5. Generate tags and summary
6. Create visual thumbnail

All orchestrated by Convex workflows.

## Feature Spotlight Tweets

### Capture Features

156. Save from anywhere. Web, mobile, browser extension. Everything syncs in real-time. No "I'll add this later" — just save and it's there.

157. The browser extension is the hero feature. One click and whatever you're looking at is saved, tagged, and searchable. Didn't even break your flow.

158. **8 types of content you can save in Teak:**
• Links — with auto-metadata
• Images — rich previews
• Videos — embed and watch
• Audio — AI transcribed
• Text — quick notes
• Documents — PDFs, files
• Palettes — extracted colors
• Quotes — with context

Your creative life is multimodal. Your bookmarking tool should be too.

159. Just pasted a link into Teak and it automatically:
- Fetched the metadata
- Generated tags
- Created a summary
- Extracted images
- Detected the category

This is what bookmarking should feel like.

160. Mobile capture matters. See something in the wild? Snap it, save it, find it later. Works offline, syncs when you're back.

### AI Features

161. What if your bookmarking tool actually read everything you saved?

Teak uses AI to:
- Auto-tag your saves
- Generate summaries
- Categorize content
- Transcribe audio
- Extract colors from images

162. I don't organize my bookmarks. AI does it for me. Auto-tagging, auto-summarization, auto-categorization. The future of bookmarking is zero-organization.

163. Just saved a design and Teak automatically extracted the color palette. This is why I built it — inspiration should be useful, not just stored.

164. Teak's AI just categorized my last 50 saves and I didn't lift a finger. Tags, categories, summaries — all done before I could refresh the page.

165. Save a voice note. Get back AI-generated text. That's Teak audio cards. Capture ideas out loud, search them as text later.

### Rediscovery Features

166. Search across your content, notes, tags, summaries, and metadata — all at once. Seven fields, one search box, instant results.

167. Found something I saved 6 months ago by searching for a feeling. That's the power of AI semantic search.

168. The best search is the one where you actually find what you're looking for. Not "exact match only" — actual understanding of what you saved.

### Visual Features

169. Why do bookmarking tools look like spreadsheets from 1999? Your inspiration deserves better. Teak is visual-first. Masonry grid, rich previews, instant visual context.

170. Dark mode by default. Because creatives live in the dark, and our tools should too.

171. Masonry grid. Rich previews. Visual browsing. Bookmarking for people who care about design. Your eyes will thank you.

172. Just saved an image and Teak automatically extracted the color palette. Designers, this one's for you. Save a design, get the colors.

173. Visual-first means scanning by eye, not reading titles. See the pattern, recognize the thumbnail, find what you need. That's how creatives work.

## Building in Public

174. Week 1 of building Teak: "This is simple, just bookmarks + AI"
Week 12: "Why is thumbnail generation so hard?"

175. Just merged PR #47 — duplicate card detection. Small feature, huge quality of life improvement. Thanks to the community for the feedback!

176. Spent 3 hours debugging a thumbnail issue. Turned out I was rate-limiting myself. The bug was me.

177. 100 stars on GitHub! Each one is someone who trusted this project enough to click a button. That means everything. github.com/praveenjuge/teak-convex-nextjs

178. Shipping feels good. Shipping open source feels better. Today Teak is publicly available for anyone to use, fork, or contribute to.

179. Building in public is scary. Every bug is public, every design decision visible. But the feedback loop is worth it.

180. Working on open source feels different. Every contribution, every bug report, every star — it all means more. This isn't just my project anymore.

181. The hardest part of building Teak wasn't the AI. It was making the masonry grid feel smooth on mobile. Performance is polish.

182. Just got my first star from someone I don't know. Tiny milestone, huge feeling. Someone I've never met found this useful.

183. Every time I think "this is ready," I find 5 more things to fix. Shipping is a decision, not a feeling. Sometimes you just have to ship.

184. Today I learned: Convex's real-time sync makes multi-platform bookmarking actually enjoyable. Previously I was fighting race conditions constantly.

185. Just shipped [feature]. Here's what went wrong:
- Spent 2 days on edge case
- Realized I overengineered it
- Simplified, shipped in 2 hours
- Users love the simple version

186. Building in public tip: Ship before you're ready. You'll never feel ready. The feedback you get from actual users is worth more than another week of "polish."

187. Just merged a PR that adds [feature]. Thanks to [contributor] for the help! Open source means better features, faster.

188. The hardest part of open source isn't the code. It's writing good issues, documenting clearly, and making contributors feel welcome.

189. Just shipped: EXIF orientation handling for images. Now your photos actually display correctly. Small detail, big difference in UX.

190. 1,000 cards saved in my Teak instance! What started as a side project to solve my own problem is now my primary inspiration library.
