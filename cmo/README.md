# CMO Folder - Marketing & Sales Workspace for Teak

This folder is a collaborative workspace where Claude helps with marketing, sales, and content strategy for Teak.

## Purpose

- **Positioning**: Define Teak's value proposition, ideal customers, and messaging
- **Landing Page**: Website copy for teakvault.com
- **Sales**: One-pagers, pitch decks, competitive analysis, pricing
- **Content Marketing**: Blog posts, social media, tweets, email campaigns
- **Campaigns**: Launch checklists and marketing roadmaps

## How to Use

When working with Claude on marketing tasks, reference specific files in this folder:

- "Help me refine the positioning in `cmo/positioning/positioning.md`"
- "Generate 5 tweet ideas based on `cmo/content-marketing/tweets.md`"
- "Update the competitive analysis in `cmo/sales/competitive-analysis.md`"

## Folder Structure

```
