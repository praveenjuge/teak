## What is Teak?

**Teak is the visual knowledge hub for creative minds.**

Capture inspiration from anywhere—web, mobile, or browser extension. Teak's AI automatically organizes everything you save, so you can actually find what you need when you need it.

## The Problem

**Your bookmarks are where links go to die.**

- You have hundreds or thousands of bookmarks you never look at
- You know you saved something perfect for your current project... but can't find it
- Your inspiration is scattered across bookmarks, screenshots, notes apps, and folders
- You've tried Notion, Obsidian, Pocket—but they require too much manual organization

**The real pain:** It's not about storing—it's about **rediscovery**. The value of saved inspiration isn't in having it; it's in finding it when you need it.

## The Solution

**Capture should be effortless. Rediscovery should be intelligent.**

### How Teak Works:

| **2. AI Processing** | Auto-tagging, categorization, summarization, metadata extraction |
| **3. Visual Organization** | Masonry grid layout with rich previews |
| **4. Intelligent Search** | Search across content, tags, summaries, and metadata |
