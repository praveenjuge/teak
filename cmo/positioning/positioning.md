# Positioning

**Why Teak? What problem do we solve? Who is it for?**

---

## Value Proposition

### For creative professionals drowning in bookmarks and scattered inspiration, Teak is the visual knowledge hub that actually helps you rediscover what you've saved. Unlike traditional bookmarking tools that are great at capturing but terrible at helping you find things later, Teak uses AI to automatically organize, tag, and categorize everything you save—so you can actually use your inspiration, not just hoard it.

### Short Version (One-Liner)

**Teak is the visual knowledge hub for creative minds—capture inspiration from anywhere, rediscover it effortlessly.**

### Twitter Version

**Your bookmarks are where links go to die. Teak is where they come back to life.**

### Developer Version

**Open-source visual bookmarking with AI-powered rediscovery. Capture from web, mobile, or browser extension. Self-hostable, privacy-first.**

## Problem Statement

### The Core Problem: Digital Amnesia

Creative professionals are constantly consuming inspiring content—articles, designs, videos, tweets. But we're terrible at remembering what we've saved and where we saved it.

**Symptoms:**
- You have 1,000+ browser bookmarks you never look at
- You save things to read later but forget they exist
- You know you saw something perfect for your current project... but can't find it
- Your inspiration is scattered across bookmarks, screenshots, notes apps, and folders
- You've tried Notion, Obsidian, Pocket—but they require too much manual organization

**The Real Pain:**
It's not about storing—it's about **rediscovery**. The value of saved inspiration isn't in having it; it's in being able to surface the right thing at the right time.

**Why Existing Tools Fail:**
| Tool | Why It Fails |
|------|--------------|
| Browser bookmarks | No metadata, no search, no visual previews, forgotten |
| Pocket/Instapaper | Great for reading, terrible for rediscovery later |
| Notion | Too much friction to save quickly, requires manual organization |
| Obsidian | Text-first, requires maintenance, not visual |
| Pinterest | Public by default, social not personal, no full-text search |
| Raindrop | Good for organization, weak on AI-powered rediscovery |

## Solution

### Teak: The Rediscovery Engine

Teak is designed around one insight: **capture should be effortless, but rediscovery should be intelligent.**

#### How Teak Solves It:

**1. Capture Frictionlessly**
- Browser extension: Save any page with one click
- Mobile app: Capture photos, screenshots, voice notes on the go
- Web interface: Paste links, upload files, write notes
- Works everywhere, syncs in real-time

**2. Process Automatically with AI**
- **Auto-tagging**: Understands content and adds relevant tags
- **Categorization**: Detects if it's an article, book, movie, product, etc.
- **Summarization**: Creates summaries so you remember why you saved it
- **Metadata Extraction**: Pulls title, description, images, and more
- **Color Extraction**: Creates palettes from images
- **Transcription**: Transcribes audio notes automatically

**3. Organize Visually**
- Masonry grid layout lets you scan by eye
- Rich previews show content at a glance
- 8 card types: text, links, images, videos, audio, documents, palettes, quotes
- Filter by type, favorites, or search

**4. Rediscover Intelligently**
- Multi-field search across content, notes, tags, summaries, metadata
- AI-powered semantic search (coming soon)
- Visual browsing with instant previews
- Combines filters to narrow down

### The Teak Difference in Three Words

**2. Visual** — See everything at a glance, not buried in folders
**3. Seamless** — Same experience across web, mobile, and browser

## The "Why Teak" Statement

**You save things because they inspire you. But inspiration is only valuable if you can find it when you need it.**

Teak is the first bookmarking tool built around rediscovery, not just capture. We use AI to understand everything you save—reading the content, extracting the meaning, creating connections—so that weeks or months later, you can search for a feeling, a color, a concept, and find exactly what you're looking for.

Stop hoarding bookmarks. Start building a visual knowledge base that actually works for you.

## Anti-Positioning

### What Teak is NOT:

- **Not a note-taking app** — We're for capturing inspiration, not writing documents
- **Not a task manager** — We're for ideas, not to-dos
- **Not a team tool** — We're personal-first, though teams can collaborate
- **Not a social network** — Your inspiration is yours, no feeds, no likes
- **Not a file system** — We don't replace Google Drive or Dropbox
- **Not for everything** — We're for creative inspiration, not receipts, taxes, or medical records

### Who Teak is NOT for:

- People who want a complex knowledge graph (use Obsidian)
- People who need real-time collaboration (use Notion)
- People who want to share publicly (use Pinterest)
- People who only save text articles (use Pocket)
