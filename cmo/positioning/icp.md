## Who We Should NOT Focus On

### Not a Fit (Yet)

| Segment | Why Not |
|---------|---------|
| Students | Limited budget, different use case (studying, not creative work) |
| Enterprise | Too many compliance requirements, we're early-stage |
| Non-technical consumers | High support needs, not our core audience |
| Academic researchers | Need citation management, different workflow |

**We're not saying "no"—just not prioritizing marketing to them.**
