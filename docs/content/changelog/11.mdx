We’ve boosted reliability with full‑stack Sentry monitoring and added rate‑limiting for smoother card creation. Link previews now use the Kernel engine with stealth mode for faster, private screenshots, and AI metadata generation has moved to Groq for quicker, cost‑effective results. UI tweaks bring new icons, better accessibility, and a refreshed masonry layout.
