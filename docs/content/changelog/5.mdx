We’ve added a new Pricing page with clear plans and FAQs, rolled out the SN Pro font across the web app, docs, and extension, and improved layout responsiveness with a fresh masonry grid. Card management is now smoother thanks to a split modal experience and server‑rendered subscription pages.

### Highlights

- ✨ **New Feature**: Pricing page with clear plans and FAQs launched.
- ✨ **New Feature**: SN Pro font applied throughout web, docs, and extension.
- 💪 **Improvement**: Masonry grid switched to react‑masonry‑css for responsive layouts.
- 💪 **Improvement**: Card modal split into dedicated screens and subscription page now SSR for faster load.
