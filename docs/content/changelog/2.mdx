We’ve refreshed the onboarding flow, upgraded card handling with Microlink metadata, added drag‑and‑drop uploads with progress, and introduced a native macOS app. Plus, authentication, context‑menu saving, and subscription pages are now smoother and more reliable.

### Highlights

- ✨ **New Feature**: Drag‑and‑drop file upload with progress overlay
- 💪 **Improvement**: Onboarding, sign‑in and sign‑up screens redesigned
- ✨ **New Feature**: MacOS Teak app released with full extension
- 🐛 **Bug Fix**: Metadata handling simplified, legacy fields cleaned up
