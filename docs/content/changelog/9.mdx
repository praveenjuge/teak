We’ve added an Admin Dashboard, gave you control over your account with deletion and better avatar uploads, and switched to BetterAuth for a smoother sign‑in experience. Plus, we polished UI colors and cleaned up test credentials for a more polished look.

### Highlights

- ✨ **New Feature**: Admin Dashboard with data overview and UI components.
- ✨ **New Feature**: Account deletion support and improved avatar upload experience.
- 💪 **Improvement**: Migrated to BetterAuth for streamlined authentication and clearer errors.
- 🐛 **Bug Fix**: Fixed popover colors for contrast and removed test credentials.
