We’ve swapped to BetterAuth for smoother sign‑ins, added an Admin Dashboard, introduced account deletion and a richer avatar uploader, and refined the UI with theme settings and subscription tweaks.

### Highlights

- ✨ **New Feature**: Admin Dashboard with data fetching and UI components.
- ✨ **New Feature**: BetterAuth integration replaces Clerk for faster, more reliable authentication.
- ✨ **New Feature**: Account deletion and enhanced avatar upload give users more control.
- 💪 **Improvement**: Theme selection moved to Settings and UI colors refined for better contrast.
