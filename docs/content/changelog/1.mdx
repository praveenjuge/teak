### Highlights

- ✨ **New Feature**: New Payments page with Polar-powered subscriptions and free tier messaging improvements.
- ✨ **New Feature**: Smarter cards with favorites, trash, and AI-driven metadata and link previews.
- ✨ **New Feature**: Command palette and upgraded search with tags, filters, and server-side queries.
- 💪 **Improvement**: More consistent UI: reusable loading states, refined modals, and masonry image layout.
