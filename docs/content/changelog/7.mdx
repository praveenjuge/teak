We’ve overhauled the subscription upgrade flow and introduced a native Polar checkout, making upgrades and payments smoother than ever. A new GlobalError component now catches unexpected issues with a friendly fallback, while UI tweaks polish card modals, link previews, and dark‑mode visuals for a more polished experience.

### Highlights

- ✨ **New Feature**: Redesign the upgrade experience with a clearer flow and updated UI.
- ✨ **New Feature**: New Polar checkout integration streamlines billing directly in the app.
- 💪 **Improvement**: GlobalError component provides a graceful fallback for unexpected errors.
- 🐛 **Bug Fix**: Polished card modal and link preview UI, adding dark‑mode support and reducing flicker.
