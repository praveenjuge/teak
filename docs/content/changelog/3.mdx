We've boosted Teak’s card workflow with direct file downloads, AI‑powered link metadata, and fresh card types like palette and quote. Loading feels smoother with skeletons, and dark mode looks sharper with new borders—all while keeping the interface clean and responsive.

### Highlights

- ✨ **New Feature**: Download files directly from cards and preview audio transcripts
- ✨ **New Feature**: New palette and quote card types with live previews
- 💪 **Improvement**: AI metadata now auto‑generates for links and supports migrations
- 🐛 **Bug Fix**: Dark mode border added to CardModal dialogs for better contrast
